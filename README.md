<h1 id='description'>The Tech Blog <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT"><img alt="The MIT License" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg" /></a></h1><br />This is a rudimentary tech blog made for me as well as other collaborators I wish to invite. Currently, what exists is a basic posting repository, where users can post short form articles about whatever they wish. Please note that this project is very much not done. I plan to implement a likes system as well as more complete CSS. This is just what I was able to accomplish within a very, very busy week.<br />Project URL: <a href="https://the-tech-board-ee3d9cb05afc.herokuapp.com/">Here</a><br /><strong>Link:</strong> <a href=https://github.com/Shrcker/The-Freak-Board>Github Link</a><br /><img src=./images/blog-screen.png alt="Project Screenshot" /><br /><h3>Table of Contents</h3><ol><li><a href="#description"><span>Description</span></a></li><li><a href="#usage"><span>Usage</span></a></li><li><a href="#credits"><span>Credits</span></a></li><li><a href="#license"><span>License</span></a></li><li><a href="#questions"><span>Questions</span></a></li></ol><br /><h2 id='usage'> Usage</h2><br /> Visit the URL and make an account.
